## Overview

Xela-Gallery is a powerful Flask-based web application designed to showcase 3D models while ensuring an immersive and interactive user experience. It allows users to explore and engage with 3D art in a modern, intuitive interface.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication (Login / Register)**:  
  Easy-to-use login and sign-up system. Users can create an account or log in quickly with just a few steps.

- **3D Model Viewer**:  
  Uses modelviewer.dev in HTML to display interactive 3D models with no need for extra JavaScript‚Äîjust a simple module.

- **Secure Database with MySQL**:  
  User data is stored securely using a MySQL database. Passwords are hashed using `werkzeug.security`'s `generate_password_hash` and verified with `check_password_hash`, ensuring strong security practices are followed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

---

### 2. Create Database and User

Log into MariaDB:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Then execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_database;

CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EXIT;
```

---

## Managing Tables

### 1. Show All Databases

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### 2. Select a Database

```sql
USE my_database;
```

### 3. View Table Contents

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### 4. Delete a Row From a Table

To delete a row by its ID:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

> üîç **Note:** Be sure to replace `users` with your table name and `1` with the actual ID you want to delete.
